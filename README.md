# Twitch Follower

Twitch Follower is a simple single-page application that tracks the status of my favorite Twitch.tv streamers. It was inspired by the [Free Code Camp challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api) and built in order to gain practical experience with React and Bootstrap.

### Technology

Twitch Follower is written in React, using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) bootstrapper. API calls were tested in Postman, and Bootstrap was utilized to aid in styling.

### Planned Features

* Ability to check the status of any streamer by entering their stream name.

* Periodic component refresh to avoid having to manually refresh the page to check for changes in streamer status.
